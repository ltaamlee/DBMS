Key Features:

* A compact ribbon UI. It is designed to provide more space for content. In simplified ribbon view, you can display many commands in a single line.

* The Gallery Bar provides a gallery of items. C1Ribbon supports interesting features like grouping, filtering and zooming items within the gallery.
* The Quick Access Toolbar (QAT) provides users access to frequently used items. The user can customize the Quick Access Toolbar and add more items from tabs and groups in the ribbon.
* Provide icon sets for representing commands. It is available in many sizes, display-modes and screen resolutions. The new C1Ribbon control provides icons for low, medium and high DPI environments.
* Offer a new set of embedded images for low contrast and high contrast themes. This adds a better visual appearance to the ribbon.
* Support Key Tips. You can use key tips to provide quick keyboard access to ribbon items.
